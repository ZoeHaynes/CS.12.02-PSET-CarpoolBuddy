The CIS community has been making a few strides towards reducing carbon emissions. DITO (Drop in the Ocean) created a report that calculated that the CIS community emits an estimated 214 tons of CO2 and approximately 6.4 million kilometers annually from commuting. One of DITO’s possible solutions to reducing this number is to have fewer students travel to school by personal cars. About 32% of our commuting is done by driving single-family cars to CIS. Our key findings and main problems currently are:

1. The community has no way of knowing who is driving at what time.
2. The community has no way of knowing who lives where in HK.
3. There is no system to share and “book” a ride.
4. There is no way to encourage using electric cars other than through emails.
5. There is no reward system to encourage students and parents to carpool to school.
6. There is no way to book alternative transportation, like bicycles, helicopters, or segways. 

This application offers a potential solution to these issues. It allows CIS community members to book Carpooling rides with other members of the community, start their own rides, and more!
